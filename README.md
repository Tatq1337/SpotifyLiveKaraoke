# SpotifyLiveKaraoke

Program is tracking your current playing track on spotify and printing lyrics (in terminal for now, maybe I'll change it later). Tracking is live so it's printing lyrics everytime the song is switched.
 
Everything here is made just for self-development purposes.
*if you dont have modules like spotipy / lyricsgenius you have to install them using pip

please spotify dont sue me :/
